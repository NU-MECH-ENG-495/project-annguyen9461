Idea 1: Using AR glasses to control robot hand
I want to use AR glasses (https://brilliant.xyz/)to control a robot hand (https://www.allegrohand.com/). The input would be my hand gestures in the field of vision of the glasses and the output is the robot hand copying my gesture. I want to try tasks like: pick and place, maybe some simple ASL letters/numbers 
The first step for me to solve this problem is using a computer vision algorithm in C++ to detect my hand gesture. I would also have to set up the control system for the hand with ROS2 and C++.
Idea 2: Using AR glasses to detect objects in the environment and have the bounding box to categorize them in the field of vision. A stretch goal would be to use a specific hand gesture to point to the object and read out loud the name of the object.
